### üöß PENDING SETUP (Where We Left Off)

#### Docker Desktop Installation
**Status**: In progress - Docker CLI installed but Docker Desktop needs setup

**What was attempted**:
- Docker CLI version 28.3.0 installed via brew
- Attempted `brew install --cask docker-desktop` (had permission issues)
- Downloaded Docker.dmg manually to ~/Downloads/

**Next steps needed**:
1. Install Docker Desktop from the downloaded DMG
2. Start Docker Desktop application
3. Verify Docker daemon is running

#### Database Setup
**Status**: PostgreSQL installed and running, but needs database creation

**Next steps needed**:
1. Create the database: `createdb live_coding_platform`
2. Or start Docker Compose services: `docker compose up -d`

## üîß IMMEDIATE TODOs

### High Priority (Blocking Development)
1. **[ ] Complete Docker Desktop Installation**
   - Mount and install from ~/Downloads/Docker.dmg
   - Start Docker Desktop
   - Verify with `docker ps`

2. **[ ] Database Setup**
   - Choose: local PostgreSQL OR Docker Compose
   - Create `live_coding_platform` database
   - Test connection

3. **[ ] Start Development Environment**
   - Run `yarn install` (if needed)
   - Start services with `yarn dev`
   - Verify frontend at http://localhost:3000
   - Verify backend at http://localhost:5000

### Medium Priority (Post-Setup)
4. **[ ] Test Core Features**
   - User registration/login flow
   - Pad creation and editing
   - Real-time collaboration between browser tabs
   - Code execution in different languages

5. **[ ] Docker Code Execution Testing**
   - Test JavaScript execution
   - Test Python execution
   - Test other languages (TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, C++)
   - Verify security isolation

## üß™ TESTING NEEDED

- [ ] Python: `print("Hello World")`
- [ ] TypeScript: type checking and execution
- [ ] Error handling for syntax errors
- [ ] Timeout handling for infinite loops
- [ ] Memory limit enforcement

### UI/UX
- [ ] Monaco Editor functionality

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES

### None Currently Known
All major TypeScript errors have been resolved and the application builds successfully.

## üìã DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS

### Quick Reference
```bash
# Start all services
yarn dev

# Start backend only (with hot reload)
cd apps/backend && yarn dev

# Start frontend only
cd apps/frontend && yarn dev

# Build everything
yarn build

# Type check
yarn type-check

# Database setup (Docker)
docker compose up -d

# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```
